Here are some suggested solutions for the workshop challenges. Keep in mind that there are many ways to solve each problem, and any answer that works is as correct as any other.

I've included a proposed solution to the bonus challenge: bonus.sh
Also included is a shortened down version, "bottles", in which I tried making the solution as short as possible, while retaining correct output.

I hope you enjoyed the course, and that you will benefit from your knowledge of shell scripting for years to come. If you have any feedback, either on the course or the workshop, I would really like to hear about it so I can improve it further. 

I would also like to point you to this excellent resource for examples and explanations of bash shell scripting, a reference that is useful for beginners and experts alike:

Best regards and happy scripting,
